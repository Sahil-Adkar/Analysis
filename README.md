This project analyzes data from the World Happiness Report to examine the relationship between a country's GDP per capita and its citizens' happiness levels, measured using the Life Ladder score.

The project begins by importing the necessary Python libraries and reading in the data from a CSV file. Then, several data cleaning steps are performed to remove unnecessary columns and missing values.

Next, the data is visualized using various graphs and charts to gain insight into the relationship between GDP per capita and Life Ladder score.

The analysis then goes further to explore if countries with high GDP per capita have a higher Life Ladder score than those with lower GDP per capita, and if countries with a higher Life Ladder score have a higher degree of social support, freedom, and generosity.

Finally, the project concludes with an evaluation of the results and recommendations for policymakers to promote happiness and well-being in their countries.

All the code and analysis is stored in a Jupyter Notebook and uploaded to GitHub for easy sharing and collaboration.
